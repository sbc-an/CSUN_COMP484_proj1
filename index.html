      <p>When given a project, one of the biggest <i>interest</i> naturally becomes the project itself, at least temporarily. Therefore, this website will be about the tags and attributes I've chosen for the project. Of course, that's just an excuse. I didn't feel like sharing a personal interest.</p>
      <p>I have deliberately chosen 3 tags specifically tied to JavaScript usage and relevant attributes. Below are some of my thoughts on the assignment.</p>
      <h3>Commenting</h3>
      <p>While comments are useful tools to communicate with your future self and fellow engineers when working on code, a diligent enginner should always strive to write self-documenting code: it is the "best practice" after all. Human-readable and well-organized code is far more maintainable than lightweight, minimized code. In fact, the whole reason we have indenting standards is for this very reason. It really isn't that much of a step beyond that to ensure all your names are descriptive and things are organized well. Putting comments down to describe what a code bit does should be a last-resort to ensure the code is maintainable for something that must be written in an esoteric manner due to language constraints.</p>
